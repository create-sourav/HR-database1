# 💼 HR Analytics & Attrition Risk Dashboard — Power BI + Machine Learning Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores employee attrition patterns in a corporate HR dataset to identify key risk factors driving churn, particularly among early-career professionals in the **Sales Department**.  
The analysis combines **Power BI visualization** and **Machine Learning modeling** to create a unified, data-driven understanding of attrition risk.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify departments, age groups, and job levels most prone to attrition  
- Understand behavioral and financial factors leading to exits  
- Build an ML model to predict attrition probability for each employee  
- Recommend **data-driven HR interventions** to reduce turnover

## 📁 Dataset Details
| Item | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Dataset Name** | HR database1 |
| **Total Records** | ~1,470 employees |
| **Target Variable** | `Attrition (Yes/No)` |

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

### 📈 Attrition Analytics Dashboard
![Power BI Dashboard](powerbidash.png)

### 🔺 High-Risk Segments
- **Sales Department** → highest attrition (~20.6%)  
- **Job Level 1** employees show the most churn  
- **Age 20–30** → highest leavers  
- **Marketing/Sales** education → higher attrition  
- **Sales Representatives** → most vulnerable role

### 💰 Monthly Income Trends
- Strong inverse relationship → higher income = lower attrition  
- Sales Executives & Managers → stable  
- Sales Reps & Lab Technicians → high attrition risk

### 🚫 Non-Significant Factors
`DistanceFromHome`, `OverTime`, `MaritalStatus` → minimal impact on attrition


---

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures
```DAX
Attrition Count =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(EmployeeData), EmployeeData[Attrition] = "Yes")

Attrition Rate (%) =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(EmployeeData), EmployeeData[Attrition] = "Yes"),
    COUNTROWS(EmployeeData)
)

Sum of MonthlyIncome (Attrition) =
CALCULATE(SUM(EmployeeData[MonthlyIncome]), EmployeeData[Attrition] = "Yes")

Total MonthlyIncome = SUM(EmployeeData[MonthlyIncome])

Attrition Rate by Department =
CALCULATE([Attrition Count], ALLEXCEPT(EmployeeData, EmployeeData[Department])) /
CALCULATE(COUNT(EmployeeData[EmployeeNumber]), ALLEXCEPT(EmployeeData, EmployeeData[Department]))
```

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model Summary

| Step | Method |
|------|--------|
| **Encoding** | pd.get_dummies(X, drop_first=True, dtype=int) + LabelEncoder for target |
| **Scaling** | StandardScaler() |
| **Train/Test Split** | 80 / 20 (stratified) |
| **Imbalance Handling** | BorderlineSMOTE() |
| **Model** | RandomForestClassifier() (tuned) |
| **Performance** | Accuracy ≈ 0.83  ROC-AUC ≈ 0.80 |

**🎯 Optimal Probability Threshold ≈ 0.34**  
Employees with predicted probability ≥ 0..34 are classified as High Risk.

## 🧩 Final Model Interpretation

| Probability Range | Risk Level | HR Action |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|
| 0.00 – 0.28 | 🟢 Low Risk | Normal monitoring |
| 0.28 – 0.50 | 🟡 Moderate Risk | Review workload / satisfaction |
| 0.51 – 0.70 | 🟠 High Risk | Engage proactively |
| 0.71 – 1.00 | 🔴 Very High Risk | Immediate retention focus |

---


## ✅ Business Recommendations

### 1️⃣ Early-Career Retention
Focus on employees aged 20–30 in Sales and Job Level 1.  
Provide mentorship and salary review after 12 months.

### 2️⃣ Restructure Compensation
Sales Representatives are underpaid → introduce performance bonuses & promotion paths.

### 3️⃣ Ignore Low-Impact Factors
DistanceFromHome, MaritalStatus, and OverTime have limited influence — avoid policy bias.

It enables HR teams to:

- Detect at-risk employees early  
- Focus on key drivers like OverTime and Job Satisfaction  
- Implement targeted retention strategies
